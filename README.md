# META NLP PROJECT

## Exploring Bias Detection in Reddit Comments with NLP

This project was developed in collaboration with Meta researchers as part of the Breakthrough Tech Fellowship. 

Our goal is to study and detect bias in Reddit comments across multiple dimensions (gender, race, religion, and orientation) using NLP techniques and then finetuning the BERT model to detect the bias.

### Dataset:
We used the RedditBias dataset, this contains annoted reddit comments with a bias (binary) column. We split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

### Finetuning

### Results:
- Dataset went from ~28,000 datapoints to ~11,000 datapoints after cleaning/filtering
